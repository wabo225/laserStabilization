# Getting started with remote operation of the DLC Pro

There are instructions on getting started within "`DLCpro example.vi`"

1. Check for the drivers (if not, they are included on a flash drive labelled DLC PRO. I may include the install files in this repository)
2. Set connection type to USB
3. Set the COM port properly. You can find which one to use in the Windows Device Manager under Ports (COM & LPT)
4. Run the Labview VI

If the serial number appears in a box on screen the connection was successful.
