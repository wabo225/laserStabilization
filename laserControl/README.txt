DLCpro LabVIEW demonstration 1.1.0
----------------------------------

The software is provided “as is” as an example for connecting and 
communicating with a DLC pro.

The "DLCpro example.vi" demonstrates how to establish a connection 
to a DLC pro via TCP/IP or USB, send various DeCof commands to the 
device and read the device's answer. 


The "DLCpro example.vi" needs the VIs in the folder "subVIs" to 
run. Add this folder to your Labview project to use the subVIs as 
shown at the example.

The "DLCpro example - SHG.vi" shows how to connect to a SHG pro 
system and execute the AutoAlign procedure.
