After Wavemeter Split
Beam Splitter 50/50 Diverts to Fabry Perot
Pass through 1/2 wave plate -> Polarizing Cube-> Cell -> 1/4 waveplate -> Mirror ** see 


*Mirror is Perpendicular to the beam so that probe and pump are colinear


Incoming beam horizontal polarized from earlier polarizing beam splitter

Set Up/ Theory 

Half Wave Plate is set at 45 

Quarter Wave Plate set at 45 






 To maximize overlap 
 we set the QuarterWave plate to 90 
 This allows laser to pass back through polarizing beam cube
 we can check the back reflection to make sure it is colinear 
 we adjusted the mirror without the cell in place and looked for light reflected by polarizing beam cube 1 and adgusted the perpendicular mirror to maximie the intensity of the beam--? test next with intensity meter


 Enclose experiment in cardboard as Rb Cell causes split stray beam
