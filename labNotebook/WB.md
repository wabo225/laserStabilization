Listed Accomplishments

- [x] Investigated the relationship between pc, cc, tc with intensity and wavelength
- [x] Coupling to a fiber
- [x] Observing Rubidium Doppler Broadened Emission with a camera
- [x] Several methods to optimize saturated absorption spectrum
- [x] Fabry-Perot, using camera to see modes
  - [x] Used Farby-Perot to quantify frequency drifting
- [x] Used a Michaelson Interferometer to measure wavelength
  - [x] Used the Bristol to measure wavelength and convert charts 
- [x] Spent a long time understanding the Lock-In feature of the DLCpro
- [x] I wrote python code to communicate with the Bristol, Fabry-Perot oscilloscope, and the laser
- [ ] Frequency on x axis

Statistical Questions
- [ ] At what wavelengths do we measure crossover resonances and ordinary resonances
  - These may be different from the theoretically calculated ones, the difference may be found from the index of refraction of the air in our room as apposed to the vacuous index the bristol assumes
- [ ] What is the measured width of the resonances (FWHM)?
  - [ ] How does FWHM change with temperature?

### Wavelength Calibration

cc: 146.71184 mA
pc: 62.649938 V
fq: 384228.06 GHz

$$5^2S_{1/2}:\; F=2 \rightarrow 5^2P_{3/2}:\; F=3$$
$$5^2S_{1/2}:\; F=2 \rightarrow \\ 5^2S_{1/2}:\; F_g 
\rightarrow \\ 5^2P_{3/2}:\; F=3$$

- Worked on more Bristol file stuff. 
  - For the future, set up use of :MMEMory: in the bristol library 
- Took a look at curve fitting and Quantum stuff in the library while procrastinating work on our posters

### Organization of Poster
  1. Motivation
    - [ ] A short dive into the first few sentences of my abstract.
      - [ ] Here it is particularly important that I focus on being able to answer questions
  2. Project Description
    -  Laser Stability! The title
    -  Why do lasers drift, and what elements of control are we given to minimize that: How much success is feasible?
    -  Top of Fringe
  3. Multiple Methods
    - [ ] Locking to a Cavity or to a Transition. 
      - [ ] What is our reference?
      - [ ] How does laser locking work
    - [ ] Lock-in: Derivatives by modulation and demodulation
    - [ ] PID: What is the error signal?
      - [ ] Be able to answer questions like the cycle speed
    - [ ] 
  4. Rubidium! What is it?
    - [ ] 
  6. Quantifying our success
    - [ ] Should contain charts (with error bars!) of frequency drift.
  7. Automated control and DAQ?

Posted up in the top of the student center. Feeling safe from coughing persons, we escaped our masks.

### Poster Initialization. Make slides before changing their format
- [ ] I want to make a bit of a theme. Spend some time looking for inspiration and list links here
  - [Teenage Engineering](https://teenage.engineering/products/synthesizers)
  - [Wavemaker](https://wavemakerglobal.com/the-story-of-us)
    - If I'm really interested in doing something crazy I could make a 2.5D experimental setup
