Statistical Questions
- [ ] At what wavelengths do we measure crossover resonances and ordinary resonances
  - These may be different from the theoretically calculated ones, the difference may be found from the index of refraction of the air in our room as apposed to the vacuous index the bristol assumes
- [ ] What is the measured width of the resona
- [ ] nces (FWHM)?
  - [ ] How does FWHM change with temperature?
