Goals:
Set up Fabry Perot 
Attatch to Oscillisope

PID Observations


Observing PID 2 output

Set-up
Analog Remote Control-> PC remote Control -> Signal Input --> Fine in 2(set PC to output through I/O board [PID2 settings->output channel A] Split output A back to fine in 2 and to oscilloscope to watch PID 2 output changes )

PID seems 

Observations:

Increasing laser Temp without lock knocks off resonance as seen with infrared camera and fabry perot extreme movement

With lock, brightness of camera does not seem to vary as much

Decreasing the current corresponds to left movement of pixels 

** need to check that sign is correct for pixel change and frequency change.
Left movement for the fabry perot should mean an increase in frequency and decrease in wavelength 

Test: 
Move current left --left fabry perot-- How does wavelength change-- increased 780.44nm to 780.053 

fabry moves right - increasing wavelenth decreases piezo 

7/26/21

Added linear polarizer after half wave plate to reduce power without changing current
minimum 78 um -- doppler free spectrum dissapears-- may work with 90/10 method
attempting lock at lower power


Tried to maximize signal -- reduced power until peak was less prominent-- adjusted mirror to maximize peak

TOF locking with reduced power
