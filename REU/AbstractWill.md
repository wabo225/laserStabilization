## Laser Frequency Stabilization Abstract

Resonant Faraday rotation on alkali metals can be used to monitor the polarization of dense spin-polarized helium-3 targets. If spin exchange optical pumping is used to polarize the helium-3 nuclei, small amounts of Rb and K will be present in the target. Tuning external-cavity diode lasers to the D2 transitions of Rb or K maximizes the rotation of linearly polarized light due to the Faraday effect;d allow us  to measure small magnetic fields due to the spin-polarized nuclei. To accomplish this goal the laser frequencies have to be stable over long periods of time, however this frequency drifts away from the D2 transitions with temperate, air pressure, vibrational, and other changes. We performed diagnostic interferometry to determine optical linewidth of our laser and rate of frequency drift. Then, using the doppler free absorption spectrum of Rb as a feedback mechanism, we used the Lock-in feature on the DL Pro laser to minimize both drift and optical linewidth to provide sufficient laser frequency stability for the Faraday rotation experiment.
